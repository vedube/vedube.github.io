Welcome to my academic profile! I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and currently serve as a Behavioral Research Assistant. Under the guidance of my advisor, [Francisco Galarza](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=_7s1gXcAAAAJ&hl=es), I focus on experimental and behavioral economics, aiming to understand how individuals make decisions in various economic settings.

My research interests extend to the intersection of economics and technology, particularly in the application of machine learning to analyze and predict economic behavior. Through my work, I strive to contribute to the growing field of behavioral economics, leveraging innovative methodologies to uncover insights that can inform policy and improve economic outcomes.

Feel free to explore my research projects and publications to learn more about my work and interests.
