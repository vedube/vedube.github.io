This [repository](https://github.com/vedube/Machine-Learning-models) was completed as part of the final exam for the Machine Learning for Economist course at Universidad del Pac√≠fico during the 2023-I term. The goal of the project was to utilize the tools and models we learned throughout the course to predict the average consistency of concrete after 28 days.
